Today people are looking at ways and means to better their life-style using the latest technologies that area available. Any new facility or hope appliance that promises to enhance their life-style is grabbed by the consumers. The more such facilities and appliances are added, it becomes inevitable to have easy and convenient methods and means to control and operate these appliances. Conventional wall switches are located in different parts of a house and thus necessitates manual operations like to switch on or off these switches to control various appliances. It gets virtually impossible to keep track of appliances that are running and also to monitor their performances.  A simple home automation system can be designed and developed using IoT technology that controls electrical devices at home from a remote location by a simple android smartphone. This is achieved by sending an signals to receiver present at home which is in turn connected to a hardware kit. The signals received by the receiver is transmitted to the microcontroller (Arduino UNO in This Case) which reads the message and controls the appropriate device.
